                About Aptus Evolution
                <LineBreak/>
                The Aptus evolution program shows a process of evolution via natural selection.<LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                It is governed by the following rules, and these rules only: <LineBreak/>
                # Food 'red' falls randomly, and each food item 'eaten' gives 6 energy points to the organism<LineBreak/>
                # Initially, Single-cell'd organisms are created<LineBreak/>
                ##They have, by default, a movement direction.<LineBreak/>
                ##For an organism to replicate, it must meet a certain energy threshold.<LineBreak/>
                ## The energy threshold required for an organism to replicate is calculated by its size (measured in cells) x 10 energy points<LineBreak/> 
                ##There is a 1-3% chance of a mistake occurring during replication<LineBreak/>
                ##Mutations affect the genetic code of an organism, governing structure, movement, and speed<LineBreak/>
                # When a collision occurs between 2 organisms, force is used to determine the winner<LineBreak/>
                ## Force is calculated as 'amount of cells' x 'speed', the organism with the greatest force kills the other organism, in which that killed organism now appears as 'red food'<LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                That is the rules, everything is governed by them.
